### Tech Test Overview
We have provided below the Figma link of this task. On the main page, we have a list of job sites with their corresponding status. By clicking the "Create" button we can create other job sites and add them to the list. By clicking to the jobsite name, we are redirected to the inventory dashboard for that particular job site. There, we can update items inside categories by double cliking on each cell where the content of that row will automatically be shown on the modal. Updating any specific column and hitting "Save", the content of the table should be automatically updated.
